lab Exercise 10 
📜 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of React Redux, JWT (JSON Web Token), and routing using React Router v6 concepts. It includes login functionality, Redux state management, JWT token simulation for login, and routing to manage login/logout processes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
ReactJS (v18+)
Redux Toolkit
React Router v6
JWT Token Simulation
Redux State Management
Node.js environment
CSS for UI
🚀 Features
✅ Login and Logout with JWT Simulation
✅ State Management with Redux
✅ JWT token generation simulation on login
✅ Redirect to the dashboard upon login success
✅ Return to the login page upon logout
✅ Simple routing with React Router v6
🏗️ Project Structure
The application follows this directory structure:

📜 How to Use
Login:

Enter any credentials in the provided form.
Click Login, and you will be redirected to the Dashboard page.
Dashboard:

You will land on the Dashboard page upon successful login.
Click Logout to end your session.
Logout:

Clicking the logout button will redirect you back to the Login page.
⚙️ Technical Details
Redux Toolkit: Manages user authentication states (logged in or logged out).
JWT Token: Simulated JWT token generation using the jwtUtils utility.
React Router v6: Handles routing for navigating between the Login and Dashboard pages.
Redux Actions and Reducers: Handles dispatch logic for login/logout.
📂 Dependencies
Required Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom jwt-decode

🏆 Next Steps
Here are your next steps:

Deploy the Project:

Deploy this application on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Implement a Real JWT Token Backend:

Replace the token simulation with actual JWT authentication logic using a backend server (Node.js, Express, etc.).
Add Protected Routes:

Use route guards to prevent non-logged-in users from accessing certain routes.
Expand Features:

Integrate user registration and authentication.
Add user profile features or analytics to the dashboard.
Improve UI/UX:

Enhance the design with libraries like Material-UI or TailwindCSS.
Create Unit Tests:

Write unit tests using Jest or React Testing Library for Redux actions and React components.
